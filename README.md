### What you are going to make?
Our goal as a team is to produce a software prototype capable of obstacle and cliff avoidance for a manual control car, also described as "Assisted driving". In order to test and develop the prototype we are going to make use of the SMCE emulator, as well as the software app Godot to produce maps to make extensive testing for our software solution. As another extra deliverable, and with the goal of having better controls of the car, we plan to make a more swift controlling system, made either by responsive, Non-Serial W-A-S-D controls, or with the use of a joystick.

### Why will you make it?
Assisted driving is a great way to test all the capabilities of the car, and its also outside of the domain knowledge of the entire developing team, proving an interesting challenge, as well as a learning oportunity. Aside from the learning aspect, assisted driving is still considered a relevant engineering problem.


### What problem does it solve?
Obstacle collision and cliff avoidance, In order to facilitate and make significantly safer to travel.

### How you are going to make it?
In order to develop and test we are mostly going to use the emulator SMCE-Godot, in order to have a suitable environment and perform testing we are going to make complex obstacle courses using the software engine Godot. As a possible extra deliverable we plan to study our software solution applied to a real car we also plan to make a 3d model of a car, which is to be developed using 3d modeling software.

### What kind of technology you are going to use?
**Runtime environment:** SMCE-Godot.

**Map development:** Autodesk Maya, Blender and/or Godot.

**Car logic development language:** Arduino and C++.

**Car model-sculpting:** Blender, Maya or Godot.

**GUI development language:** Java.
